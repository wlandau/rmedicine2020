Thank you all for coming, and thank you to R/Medicine for the opportunity to speak today.

In the life sciences, we develop ambitious computational workflows for Statistics and data science. There's a lot of Bayesian analysis, machine learning, simulation, and prediction. And we need to think about both efficiency and reproducibility right from the start.

## Common features

1. Heavy use of the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. Long runtimes.
3. Multiple sub-tasks.
4. Frequent changes to code and data.

???

Many of these projects require long runtimes. Methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo and deep neural nets are computationally expensive. It could take hours or even days just to fit a single model. That's fine if you're only going to run the project once, or at regularly scheduled times. But if the code is still under development, it's easy to get trapped in a vicious Sisyphean cycle.

---

## Interconnected tasks
<center>
<img src = "./images/workflow.png" align="middle" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; text-align: center;">
</center>

???

A large workflow has a large number of moving parts. We have datasets that we preprocess or simulate, analyses of those datasets, and summaries of the analyses.

---

## Changes

<center>
<img src = "./images/change.png" align="middle" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; text-align: center;">
</center>

???

If you change any one of these parts - whether it's a bugfix, a tweak to a model, or some new data -

---

## Consequences

<center>
<img src = "./images/downstream.png" align="middle" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; text-align: center;">
</center>

???

Then everything that depends on it is no longer valid, and you need to rerun the computation to bring the results back up to date. This is seriously frustrating when you're in development and you're still making a constant stream of changes to code and data in real time. If every change means you need to rerun the project, there's no way the results can keep up...

## Pipeline tools and workflow managers

<center>
<img src = "./images/infographic.svg" align="middle" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; text-align: center;">
</center>

- Several exist already: [github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline).
- Most are language-agnostic or designed for Python or the shell.

???

...unless you use a pipeline tool. There are pipeline tools for production which resemble Apache Airflow, and there are pipeline tools for development which resemble GNU Make. Today, I'm going to focus on Make-like tools because those are the ones I think are designed for this part of the process. It's an action-packed space, and there are a lot of great options. But unfortunately, there's not a whole lot for R.

## What distinguishes `drake`?

<center>
<img src = "./images/R.png" align="middle" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; text-align: center; height: 200px">
</center>

.large[
* Fundamentally designed for R.
* Supports a clean, modular, function-oriented programming style.
* Abstracts files as R objects and automatically manages data.
]

???

That's where drake comes in. drake is a Make-like pipeline tool that is fundamentally designed for R. You can call it from an R session, it supports a clean, idiomatic, function-oriented style of programming, and it helps you store and retrieve your results. Most importantly, it gets you out of the Sisyphean loop of long computation, enhances reproducibility, and takes the frustration out of data science.

## Example: COVID-19 clinical trial simulation

* Motivation: design a randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial of a potential new treatment of COVID-19.
* Goal: understand the operating characteristics of a 200-patient trial under different effect size scenarios.
* Enroll newly hospitalized patients (within 3 days of admission) who do not need supplemental oxygen or ventilation.
* Endpoint: days until the patient is discharged from the hospital.
* Decision: graduate to phase 3 at the end of the study if Prob(hazard ratio (of hospital discharge) > 1.5) > 0.6.
* Simulation:
    1. Simulate time to event data from each arm (1 treatment and 1 placebo) from normal distributions (left-truncated right-censored).
    2. Analyze with a Bayesian survival model by [Zhou, Hanson, and Zhang](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v092i09) (2020; R package [`spBayesSurv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spBayesSurv/index.html)).
    3. Aggregate over simulations to calculate operating characteristics.

???

Let's go to an example.

I am part of a capabilities team at Lilly, and much of our work revolves around the design and simulation of clinical trials. In the first several months of 2020, we helped design several trials for potential new treatments of COVID-19. We used simulation to explore the operating characteristics of these trials and determine features like sample size, primary endpoint, and even when the trial should stop.

Now this slide has a mock example clinical trial simulation study. It's not the actual simulation study for any one trial in particular, and it's oversimplified for pedagogical purposes. But it does represent how my team and I set up the computation for this kind of problem. We use drake a lot, and we use drake a lot in this way.

So this is a mock phase 2 trial, and the goal of the simulation is just to understand the trial's operating characteristics. So when is this trial going to claim the therapy works, and when is it going to claim that the therapy doesn't work? We want to design a trial that makes the correct decision without an unnecessarily large sample size. And one of the things we want to find out is whether 200 patients is a good enough.

Suppose we enroll newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients and measure the number of days until they're cleared to leave. We randomize half the patients to the treatment, half to placebo, and measure the drug's ability to shorten the hospital stay. For the end of the trial, there are multiple pre-built criteria to determine whether the therapy moves on to phase 3 studies. Suppose that we meet the efficacy criterion if the probability that the hazard ratio of hospital discharge exceeds one and a half is greater than 60%. 

We assess the design of this trial using simulation. First, we draw time to event data for each study arm from a distribution. Then, we analyze the simulated data and evaluate the efficacy rule using a Bayesian proportional hazards model. We repeat for many simulations, and we aggregate the results to figure out what efficacy decision the trial is likely to make under different scenarios.

## File structure

* Full source code: <https://github.com/wlandau/rmedicine2020>

```{r}
run.sh
run.R
_drake.R
sge.tmpl
R/
├── packages.R
├── functions.R
└── plan.R
```

???

So that's the background. Now how do we implement this? Let's have a look at the file system. We have R scripts to load our packages, custom functions, and something called a "drake plan", which I will get to later. We have a _drake.R script to configure the workflow, and some top-level "run" scripts just for convenience. We have an sge.tmpl file to distribute the workload across multiple nodes of a Univa Grid Engine cluster.

  hazard_ratio_list <- map(samples, ~as.mcmc(t(exp(.x$beta))))
  hazard_ratio <- unlist(hazard_ratio_list)
  tibble(
    prob_effect = mean(hazard_ratio > 1.5),
    median = median(hazard_ratio),
    psrf = gelman.diag(hazard_ratio_list, multivariate = FALSE)$psrf[, 1],
    patients_per_arm = patients$patients_per_arm[1],
